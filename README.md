# Hello! Welcome to 2020 Democratic candidates repository.
This is where I keep my code from a project I worked on concerning the speech of the 2020 Democratic candidates. I worked on this project mainly during the spring and fall of 2020.

I learned a lot by working on this project! I practiced **cleaning data** and **adding columns to spreadsheets**, **navigating file structures**, **plotting data**, and **building multivariate models of regression and predictive classifiers**.

I'm very proud of what I achieved during this project, and I hope to have some of the results published! Because this is an ongoing research project, _I cannot publish the data I've been using_, but I hope to make more of my materials available once we are published.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
